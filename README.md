## Project Synopsis 
 * Make it easier for people to find places to donate
 * Connect people to charities based on skills, giving needs, location, charity reviews, interest
 * Reviews
    * Star reviews based on who has donated
 * Give people donation history
    * Design UI that allows people help with their taxes thorugh having all the necessary information about their donations
 * We give people ease of connection and encouragement through:
    * Reviews
    * UI
    * Locality
  * Allow people to sign up for notifications:
    * As needs arise, notify people about opportunities that match their giving needs
  * Allow people to opt-in to a newsletter, either from specific 
    
    
 * Why this project is necessary right now:
   * Recent tax cut made less incentives for small donations; there will likely be a drop in small donations, so we want to make it as easy as possible to donate
   * Current non-profit aggregating websites do their job poorly; bad UIs that encourage donation to the website over donating to charities
   * No reviews of charities
   * Useful for new charities - we can highlight
